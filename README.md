## About

The FIT Stack is built on the Fit Stack:

> The author of The [Fit Stack](http://mvpin30.com) highly recommends
reading [ZAG](http://goo.gl/DPmCWa) and adding an onliness statement here.
After completed, you can delete this blockquote from the Markdown file.

> "What's the one thing that makes your brand both different and compelling?
What makes you the 'only'?  Complete a simple onliness statement.
Add detail by answering what, how, who, where, when, and why."
&ndash; Marty Neumeier

> (e.g. "The Fit Stack is the only boilerplate for Angular.js developers who want
a proven, quick, and easy way to build rapid MVPs in 0-30 days.")

**TODO**: FIT Stack is the only &hellip; that &hellip;

The Fit Stack is:

1. Flybase (real-time database)
2. Interface (Angular.js)
3. Thin Servers (if needed)


The FIT Stack is a powerful, but lightweight Angular.js and Flybase driven stack for making quick and powerful MVP projects as part of the [MVPin30](http://mvpin30.com) project.

Using the power of Angular.js, and Flybase, we can quickly build MVPs of new ideas and host them anywhere, even on static web hosts such as Github Pages.
